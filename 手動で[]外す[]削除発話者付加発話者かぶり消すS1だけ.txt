Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 00% Cartman:
Okay, Mom.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 00% Kyle:
Ready to go hunting, Cartman?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 01% Stan:
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 01% Jimbo:
That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 01% Liane:
Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 02% Jimbo:
Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 02% Ned:
Hello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 02% Liane:
Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy. 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 03% Cartman:
Dude, that's sick mom.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 03% Liane:
And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away. 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 03% Cartman:
Drive, Drive!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 04% Liane:
You give your mommy a kissy.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 04% Cartman:
Drive the car damn-it, drive!




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 04% Kyle:
 Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 05% Cartman:
Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 05% Stan:
Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 05% Kenny:
(Maybe she'll suck my dick)

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 06% Jimbo:
Oh, ho, that's disgusting.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 06% Cartman:
You piece of crap, I'll kill you! 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 06% Jimbo:
That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 07% Cartman:
Eeeh!  

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 07% Jimbo:
Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 08% Stan:
Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 08% Jimbo:
You what?!?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 08% Ned:
Moh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 09% Kyle:
I like chocolate milk.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 09% Jimbo:
Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like … fishing … sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 09% Jimbo:
Well, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 10% Cartman:
Hey, I didn't get a gun.  Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 10% Stan:
You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 10% Ned:
Were you stationed in De Nang?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 11% Stan:
Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 11% Cartman:
Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 11% Jimbo:
 Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 12% Stan:
My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 12% Kyle:
Wow, that'd be cool.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 12% Cartman:
My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 13% Jimbo:
Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear …one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful… By God, it's coming right for us! 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 13% Stan:
Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 13% Jimbo:
Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 14% Kyle:
What do you mean?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 14% Jimbo:
You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 15% Cartman:
Democrats piss me off!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 15% Jimbo:
They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 15% Stan:
Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 16% Ned:
Mmm, Jimbo look, mm.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 16% Jimbo:
Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!  

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 16% Cartman:
Kickass!! 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 17% Jimbo:
Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 17% Ned:
Moohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o'clock. 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 17% Jimbo:
 Let's move, moove! 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 18% Stan:
Is this hunting?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 18% Kyle:
I guess so.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 18% Cartman:
Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 19% Kyle:
What?!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 19% Cartman:
Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 19% Jimbo:
This one's yours Stan.  It's coming right for us.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 20% Ned:
It's coming right for us. 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 20% Kyle:
Shoot it Stan.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 20% Cartman:
I got your back, soldier.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 21% Stan:
 I can't. 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 21% Jimbo:
What the? What's wrong with you?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 22% Stan:
I don't want to shoot the bunny.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 22% Jimbo:
What the hell are you talking about, you don't want to shoot the bunny? You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 22% Stan:
I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 23% Jimbo:
No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree hugger.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 23% Cartman:
Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 23% Stan:
I can shoot you, fat ass!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 24% Cartman:
I can shoot you too!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 24% Stan:
I'll kill you!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 24% Cartman:
I'll fill you full of lead!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 25% Kyle:
 Hey, what's that?




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 25% Randy:
 What the heck is this?  Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, good. Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? … Uh huh … Uh huh … Let me check  Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano! 




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 25% Cartman:
My weenies won't cook.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 26% Ned:
Mmm, this wood won't burn, umm.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 26% Jimbo:
Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 26% Ned:
Mmm, yepper.  Mmm, aahh, oh.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 27% Jimbo:
Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!! 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 27% Stan, Kyle:
Whoa!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 27% Jimbo:
Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 28% Ned:
Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 28% Cartman:
 Hey you guys, this works pretty good right now.




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 29% Chef:
But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 29% Mayor:
We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but… 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 29% Johnson:
Mayor, the geologist is here to see you.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 30% Mayor:
My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 30% Johnson:
No mayor, that's a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 30% Mayor:
Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 31% Johnson:
I'm not in your office mayor, I'm talking to you through a speaker.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 31% Mayor:
 Just send in the geometrist.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 31% Johnson:
Geologist…

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 32% Mayor:
You are fired, buddy!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 32% Johnson:
Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 32% Randy:
 Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 33% Mayor:
What does this mean to the town?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 33% Randy:
Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.  Right now South Park is here.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 33% Mayor:
My God!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 34% Chef:
Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 34% Mayor:
Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 34% Ted:
Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I'm his replacement, Ted.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 35% Mayor:
Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh.  Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control.




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 35% Jimbo:
You see… Ned picked up the grenade and… BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 36% Ned:
 Mmmowwwh. 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 36% Jimbo:
Hah, got ya.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 36% Cartman:
Heh, that's not scary.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 37% Kyle:
You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 37% Cartman:
Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 37% Jimbo:
Hey Ned, hand me that gin.  You boys want to tie one on?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 38% Kyle:
No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 38% Stan:
Yeah, Cartman's pee.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 38% Cartman:
Hey, you would taste my pee!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 39% Jimbo:
What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?  Christ, look at that little bastard go!  Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 39% Stan:
Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 39% Cartman:
Hey you guys. I know a scary story.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 40% Kyle:
Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 40% Cartman:
 Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 40% Stan:
Whatabutt?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 41% Cartman:
Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 41% Stan:
Why?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 41% Cartman:
Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 42% Kyle:
Deformed how?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 42% Cartman:
Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has…

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 43% Stan:
A hook.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 43% Kyle:
A knife.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 43% Cartman:
No! A piece of celery.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 44% Stan:
Celery?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 44% Cartman:
Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but…Patrick Duffy.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 44% Kyle:
Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 45% Cartman:
What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink … tahink … tahink.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 45% Stan:
Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 45% Kyle:
Yeah, give me that flashlight. 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 46% Kenny:
 (Hey, what's that?)

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 46% Kyle:
What is that?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 46% Stan:
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 47% Cartman:
Hey, it might be!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 47% Kyle:
Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 47% Cartman:
Screw you guys! … Go to Hell!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 48% Jimbo:
 Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 48% Ned:

Abumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Kumbayah my lord, kumbayah. 
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah. 
Moh lord, Kumbayah.

Emsomeone's crying my lord, Kumbayah
Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah...



発話者            Season_One   Volcano 48% Cartman:
They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 49% Ned:

… Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah.
Moh lord, Kumbayah.






発話者            Season_One   Volcano 49% Kyle:
Stan, Stan, wake up!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 50% Stan:
What, dude?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 50% Kyle:
I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 50% Stan:
Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 51% Kyle:
They're out fishing with Kenny.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 51% Stan:
With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 51% Kyle:
Well Stan, you want to know what I think?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 52% Stan:
What? 




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 52% Jimbo:
What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there! 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 52% Ned:
Mmm, got it. 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 53% Jimbo:
Great instincts boy.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 53% Stan:
 Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 53% Jimbo:
Who? The fat kid?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 54% Stan:
Yeah.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 54% Jimbo:
Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!  Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 54% Ned:
 Moh man it smells like dead fish here.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 55% Kenny:
(A little like a vagina.)

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 55% Ned:
Em-moh man, that is nasty.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 55% Jimbo:
Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 56% Kenny:
(Thanks.) 




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 56% Newscaster:
The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking timebomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 56% Crowd:
Yeahhh. 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 57% Individual in crowd:
Hey, I'm on TV! I'm on TV!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 57% Newscaster:
Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 58% Mayor:
All we know right now is that some of our children  are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 58% Newscaster:
Huh?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 58% Mayor:
You can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1  All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 59% Chef:
Come on everybody. You got to help the children.




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 59% Jimbo:
Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 59% Ned:
There's not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 60% Jimbo:
Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.  Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 60% Ned:
Mm I don't know man. I've got some bad gas.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 60% Jimbo:
Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!  Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 61% Kyle:
Look!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 61% Cartman:
I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 61% Ned:
Mmm, what is it?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 62% Kyle:
Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 62% Jimbo:
Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 62% Ned:
We'll be on the cover of Guns &amp; Ammo.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 63% Jimbo:
This calls for some HJ-14.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 63% Cartman:
Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 63% Jimbo:
 Fire in the hole!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 64% Cartman:
Holy crap! 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 64% Jimbo:
Damn it, I think I missed

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 65% Cartman:
What the hell is wrong with you people?!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 65% Jimbo:
C'mon, let's move, move!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 65% Cartman:
 Hey, wait, aah!




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 66% Mayor:
Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 66% Randy:
Mayor, I might have an idea.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 66% Mayor:
Huh, what?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 67% Randy:
If we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park, pretty much completely.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 67% Mayor:
And, that would be good? Alright?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 67% Randy:
Uh - pretty sure.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 68% Mayor:
Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 68% Jimbo:
These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!!  The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 68% Kyle:
 Look, up there.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 69% Cartman:
You guys, it's just me.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 69% Jimbo:
Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 69% Stan:
Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 70% Jimbo:
I can't tell; let's kill it!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 70% Cartman:
Eh, I gotta get out of this stupid costume.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 70% Jimbo:
Kenny, you take the front.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 71% Stan:
No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 71% Jimbo:
That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 72% Cartman:
You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 72% Newscaster:
As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary.




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 72% Officer Barbrady:
Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please. 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 73% Host:
Harbringers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It's a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt.  That's right Jane, duck and cover.  So what will you-do when you hear a volcano erupting?  That's right, duck and cover.  Looks like you got the idea.Thank you and goodbye.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 73% Officer Barbrady:
OK, any questions?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 73% Chef:
That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 74% Officer Barbrady:
That's enough out of you!




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 74% Stan:
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 74% Cartman:
Hey, seriously you guys!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 75% Kyle:
 Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 75% Stan:
Ah, damn it, I can't do it!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 75% Jimbo:
 You pansy! give me that gun.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 76% Cartman:
Hey!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 76% Stan:
Cartman?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 76% Cartman:
Goddammit, don't shoot me!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 77% Jimbo:
What in Sam Hell?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 77% Cartman:
I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 77% Ned:
Mmm, so much for the cover of Guns &amp; Ammo.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 78% Jimbo:
Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that- 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 78% Kyle:
Whoa!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 79% Ned:
Mmm, holy crap.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 79% Jimbo:
The mountain! It's blown it's top! 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 79% Kyle:
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 80% Kenny:
 (Nope, I'm okay.)  (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)  (Ugh.)




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 80% Townsman 1:
Look, the volcano.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 80% Townsman 2:
Quick, duck and cover. 




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 81% Kyle, Stan, Cartman:
Aaaaah!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 81% Jimbo:
That lava's coming right for us!! 




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 81% Chef:
Oh no, look.




発話者            Season_One   Volcano 82% Jimbo:
What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 82% Newscaster:
It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 87% Officer Barbrady:
This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 87% Jimbo:
Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed. 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 87% Kyle:
Aaaaah! 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 88% Stan:
Whoa, he built a wicker basket

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 88% Jimbo:
Hey, he's saving us.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 88% Scuzzlebutt:
 Grrr.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 89% Liane:
Scuzzlebutt saved the day.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 89% Randy:
And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 89% Mayor:
Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 90% Randy:

No.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 97% Ned:

(Oh, no!) 

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 98% Stan:
But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 98% Jimbo:
But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 98% Kyle:
Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 99% Stan:
Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.

発話者            Season_One   Volcano 99% Cartman:

Whatever, dude.

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 92% Stan:
Hey, I didn't throw up.

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 93% Wendy:
Cool! 

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 93% Stan:

Hey, look. A French fry.

Cool.

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 94% Wendy:
And what is that?

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 94% Stan:
I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 95% Wendy:
Hey, what's that?

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 95% Stan:
That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 95% Wendy:
Hey, what about that?

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 95% Stan:
I don't know what the hell that is...







発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 96% Stan:
Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 96% Kyle:
Yeh, we're running out of friends.

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 96% Stan:
I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.




発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 96% Cows:
Mooo.

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 97% Officer Barbrady:
Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now. 

I love to sing-a
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a
I love to sing-a
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...








発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 97% Cartman:
Puh!

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 97% Stan:
Oh, hey Cartman.

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 97% Kyle:
Wow Cartman, the visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 98% Cartman:
Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 98% Stan:
Really, what about?

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 98% Cartman:
Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there were... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 98% Stan:
That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 99% Cartman:
Alright. Why don't I have pinkeye then?

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 99% Kyle:
Cartman, you do have pinkeye!

発話者            Season_One   Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe 99% Cartman:

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 00% Kyle:
Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 00% Stan:
Yeah, it was huge.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 00% Cartman:
Heh, I hate those things.

Kyle
Nobody hates rainbows.

Stan
Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 01% Cartman:
Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like, "Hey, get out of my ass you stupid rainbows!" 

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 01% Stan:
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 01% Cartman:
I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 02% Kyle:
Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 02% Cartman:
Ohh, rainbows. Yeah, I like those, those are cool.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 02% Stan:
What were you talking about?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 03% Cartman:
Heh, oh, nothing, forget it.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 03% Kyle:
No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 03% Cartman:
Nothing..!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 04% Mr. Garrison:
Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month?  One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 04% Wendy:
 Wow, I knew I would win.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 04% Mr. Hat:
Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 05% Mr. Garrison:
That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 05% Wendy:
What?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 05% Cartman:
What?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 06% Mr. Garrison:
Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 06% Cartman:
Kick ass!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 06% Stan:
That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 07% Cartman:
Yeah I do, pop tarts are frosted.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 07% Mr. Garrison:
Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 07% Kyle:
Wow, what did you write about Cartman?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 08% Cartman:
Oh, you know, this and that.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 08% Wendy:
He doesn't even know what he wrote about!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 08% Kyle:
What was your paper about Wendy?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 09% Wendy:
My paper was on the suffering of bottlenose dolphins.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 09% Cartman:
There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 09% Stan:
Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 10% Cartman:
Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 10% Wendy:
What?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 10% Mr. Garrison:
Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 11% Kyle:
Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 11% Mr. Garrison:
And the presentation will be on national television.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 11% Stan, Kyle:
Television!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 12% Mr. Garrison:
 Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't believe it.




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 12% Mayor:
Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 12% Aide 1:
Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 13% Mayor:
Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 13% Aide 2:
Maybe even a State Senator.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 13% Aide 1:
Mayor, we should decorate the town square.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 14% Aide 2:
Then we should have the chef of the school cafeteria sing a song, and play up the ethnic diversity of our town.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 14% Mayor:
That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 14% Aide 1:
Black as the night itself Mayor.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 15% Mayor:
Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 15% Aide 1:
If they're working in a sweat-shop that is.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 15% Aide 2:
Ohhh.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 16% Aide 1:
Ouch.  Thank you.




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 16% Cartman:
You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 16% Wendy:
 Hitler was famous too.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 17% Chef:
 Hello there children.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 17% Kyle, Stan:
Hey, Chef.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 17% Chef:
How are my little crackers today?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 18% Kyle, Stan:
Good.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 18% Chef:
Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 18% Stan:
Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 19% Cartman:
Hey!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 19% Chef:
Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 19% Kyle:
Wow, are you gonna do it?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 20% Chef:
Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 20% Stan:
Yeah, that'd be cool.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 20% Kenny:
(How big's your penis, Chef?)

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 21% Chef:
Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway. 




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 21% Mr. Garrison:
Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.  Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 21% Mr. Hat:
Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 22% Mr. Garrison:
Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago. And I was only a child.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 22% Mr. Hat:
We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge.




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 22% Lil Mr. Garrison:
Knock knock, Mr. Hat.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 23% Mr. Hat:
Who's there?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 23% Lil Mr. Garrison:
Orange.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 23% Mr. Hat:
Orange who?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 24% Lil Mr. Garrison:
Orange you glad I didn't say banana? 

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 24% Mr. Hat:
Thank you. 

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 25% Lil Mr. Garrison:
Wow Mr. Hat, looks like we might win.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 25% Show Announcer:
And now our last talent show finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 25% Lil Kathie Lee:

If they could see me now, that little gang of mine.
I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine.
I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact
The kind of top-drawer first-rate chums I attract
 All I can say is, "Wow-wee, look-a where I am."
 Tonight I landed, Pow!, right in a pot of jam.
What a setup! Holy Cow!
They'd never believe it, if my friends could see me now!





発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 26% Mr. Garrison:
 It, it wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete that?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 26% Mr. Hat:
But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 26% Mr. Garrison:
How?  No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't kill Kathie Lee Gifford!




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 27% Mayor:
Children, as you all know, Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 27% Cartman:
That kid is me.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 27% Mayor:
Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 28% Mr. Garrison:
That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 28% Mr. Hat:
Kill her.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 28% Mr. Garrison:
 Mr. Hat!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 29% Mayor:
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 29% Mr. Garrison:
Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 29% Wendy:
Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 30% Mayor:
Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best.  And who's our little prize winner again?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 30% Cartman:
Me! Eric Cartman!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 30% Mayor:
How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 31% Cartman:
Yes ma'am. I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television.




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 31% Cartman:
...I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television...

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 31% Stan:
 We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 32% Cartman:
Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 32% Stan:
Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 32% Cartman:
Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 33% Stan:
Dolphins are way smarter than you!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 33% Cartman:
If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 50% Mayor:
Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 50% Mr. Garrison:
Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage.  Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage .

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 51% Clyde:
Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 51% Mr. Garrison:
Do you have a feather on your head?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 51% Clyde:

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 53% Mayor:
Oh, don't they look adorable?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 53% Bebe:
Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers. 

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 54% Mayor:
Oh my God!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 54% Mr. Garrison:
They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 54% Bebe:
The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands. 

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 55% Mayor:
Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 55% Mr. Garrison:
Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days.

Dow!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 56% Mayor:
Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 56% Mr. Garrison:
To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!  Oh my God, what have I said?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 57% Townsman:
He said, "To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!" 

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 57% Mayor:
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play. 




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 57% Mr. Hat:
It happened again didn't it? Now we do things my way.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 58% Mr. Garrison:
I can't kill her Mr. Hat. You're gonna have to do it. 




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 58% Kyle:
Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 58% Cartman:
 Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 59% Kyle:
You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 59% Cartman:
I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 59% Kyle:
Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 60% Cartman:
No they don't, you jealous weakling!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 60% Townsman:

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 62% Jimbo:
Can I help you?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 63% Mr. Garrison:
Yes, I need a gun.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 63% Jimbo:
Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 63% Mr. Garrison:
Other.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 64% Jimbo:
Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!  That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 64% Mr. Garrison:
 You talkin' to me?  You talkin' to me? I don't know, it's a little small.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 64% Jimbo:
Okay, how about this?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 65% Mr. Garrison:
 You talkin' to me?  Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 65% Jimbo:
Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 65% Mr. Garrison:
 You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me.  I'll take it!




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 66% Wendy:

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 66% Mr. Garrison:
Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ole Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 66% Wendy:
 Oh my God.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 69% Officer Barbrady:
Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 69% Mr. Garrison:
 Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 69% Officer Barbrady:
No problem.  Hah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 70% Mayor:
 Where is she?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 70% Cartman:
 This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcake!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 70% Kyle:
I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 71% Wendy:
 You guys, we have to stop him!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 71% Kyle:
Stop who?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 71% Wendy:
Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 72% Cartman:
Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 72% Wendy:
He's got a gun!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 72% Cartman:
You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 73% Wendy:
It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 73% Stan:
Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 73% Wendy:
 Stan, I can't do it alone. Please? 

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 74% Kyle:
Uh oh, we're losing him. 

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 74% Mayor:
Here she comes. 

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 75% Mr. Garrison:
 Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 75% Townswoman:
We love you Kathie Lee, heh heh

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 76% Mayor:
 It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 76% Chef:
Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of a, a humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.

Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you down.
And lick every inch of your body with my tongue.



発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 77% Mayor:

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 80% Officer Barbrady:
Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ...

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 81% Officer Barbrady:

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 83% Wendy:
I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 84% Mr. Garrison:
You can't know.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 84% Wendy:
You should have won that talent show.




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 84% Kathie Lee:
It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 85% Cartman:
Here it is, my big moment of fame.




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 85% Mr. Garrison:
...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 85% Wendy:
I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 86% Mr. Garrison:
It is, too late for me, young Wendy.




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 86% Wendy:
You see, I've learned something today. You can't win all the time. And if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 86% Mr. Garrison:
 You... you're right.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 87% Wendy:
Gooood.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 87% Stan:
Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 87% Mr. Hat:
 The bitch must die!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 88% Kyle:
Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 89% Agent 2:

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 89% Kyle:
Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. 

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 90% TV Crew Director:
I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 90% Cartman:
Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 90% TV Crew Director:
Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 91% Cartman:
 But I won the environmental essay contest.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 91% Wendy:
You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.  I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 91% Townsman 1:
Who cares?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 92% Townsman 2:
Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 92% Stan:
Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 92% Wendy:
Well, not if it's Cartman.  Hey, where are you all going!  They don't even know what Walden is.  I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 93% Stan:
Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 93% Wendy:
Ah, what the hell. 

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 93% Mayor:
Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 94% Aide 1:
Uh, Mayor, the mic is on.




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 94% Officer Barbrady:
 Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 94% Mr. Hat:
Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 95% Officer Barbrady:
You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee and nobody got hurt. 




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 95% Stan:
We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 95% Mr. Garrison:
Well children, I'd love to, but the doctor say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 96% Mr. Hat:
 We can still get her! Let mmm--

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 96% Mr. Garrison:
I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 96% Kyle:
Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 97% Mr. Garrison:
Really, on what?




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 97% Geraldo:
Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 97% Cartman:
When is this going to be on the air?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 98% Geraldo:
Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 98% Cartman:
Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcake!




発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 98% Chef:
He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 99% Kathie Lee:
Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin' Chef?

発話者            Season_One   Weight_Gain_4000 99% Chef:
Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?

Eh. You're making me sick, dude.

発話者            Season_One   Big_Gay_Al's_Big_Gay_Boat_Ride 01% Stan:
He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.

発話者            Season_One   Big_Gay_Al's_Big_Gay_Boat_Ride 02% Cartman:
No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.

発話者            Season_One   Big_Gay_Al's_Big_Gay_Boat_Ride 02% Sylvester:
Arrrrrr

What's homecoming?

発話者            Season_One   Big_Gay_Al's_Big_Gay_Boat_Ride 08% Chef:
But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile.  Now, let's start practice.

I know Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.

発話者            Season_One   Big_Gay_Al's_Big_Gay_Boat_Ride 09% Pip:
Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?

発話者            Season_One   Big_Gay_Al's_Big_Gay_Boat_Ride 10% Chef:

発話者            Season_One   Big_Gay_Al's_Big_Gay_Boat_Ride 12% Chef:
Elementary school alumni?

発話者            Season_One   Big_Gay_Al's_Big_Gay_Boat_Ride 12% Jimbo:

発話者            Season_One   Big_Gay_Al's_Big_Gay_Boat_Ride 13% Chef:
I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?

発話者            Season_One   Big_Gay_Al's_Big_Gay_Boat_Ride 22% Mr. Garrison:
Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better 'cause they're better people.

発話者            Season_One   Big_Gay_Al's_Big_Gay_Boat_Ride 23% Cartman:

Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down.  Stanley, gay people... well- gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Naziesque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?

Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 00% Stan:
Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 00% Cartman:
Your sister beat you up again, huh?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 00% Stan:
No!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 01% Cartman:
Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 01% Stan:
She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 01% Kyle:
Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 02% Cartman:
I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 02% Stan:
My parents don't even believe that she beats me up.  They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 02% Cartman:
Be a man Stan.  Just say, "Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 03% Stan:
Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 03% Kyle:
 You mean this one?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 03% Stan:
Yeah.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 04% Kyle:
He's my new pet elephant.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 04% Stan:
Whoa dude!  Where'd you get a pet elephant?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 04% Kyle:
I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 05% Stan:
Wow, that's cool!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 05% Kyle:
No it's not cool!  My mom won't let me keep him in the house.  She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 05% Cartman:
That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig.  Cause its poop is small.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 06% Kenny:
(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 06% Stan:
Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 07% Ms. Crabtree:
Oh—I'm sorry little girl.  But you still can't get on.  You have to take the special ed bus.




発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 07% Kyle:
Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant.  See ya. 

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 07% Cartman:
 If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry and-"

 Yes ma'am.




発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 08% Mr. Garrison:
And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 09% Mr. Hat:
That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science.  You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 09% Kyle:
Mr. Garrison?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 09% Mr. Garrison:
Yes Kyle.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 10% Kyle:
With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 10% Mr. Garrison:
Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could.  You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 10% Kyle:
That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 11% Stan:
That'd be cool!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 11% Bebe:
I want a pot-bellied elephant.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 11% Pip:
Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 12% Terrance:
That's stupid.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 12% Kyle:
Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 12% Terrance:
Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 13% Kyle:
I'll bet you can't.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 13% Terrance:
Watch me plebeian.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 13% Mr. Garrison:
Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie.  Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 14% Mr. Hat:
Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 14% Mr. Garrison:
You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help.  And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month. 

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 14% Kyle:
Genetic Engineering Ranch!  Sweet!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 14% Stan:
Wait, wait.  We still need a pig.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 15% Kyle:
We can use Cartman's pig.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 15% Cartman:
Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 15% Kyle:
We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 16% Cartman:
You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts.  Kyle, Kyle no! 

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 16% Mr. Garrison:
 Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?

Okay.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 17% Mr. Garrison:
I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have.  Are there problems at home?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 17% Stan:
 Yes…

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 17% Mr. Garrison:
Oh dear.  Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it. 

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 18% Mr. Hat:
I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan.  You can tell me anything.  Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 18% Stan:
Oh, neither.  It's my sister.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 18% Mr. Garrison:
 Your sister?!  Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss.  Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!

No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.

Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 30% Kyle:
No, no, no.  We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.

It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war.  I have created things that will change the world for the better.  For instance, here is a monkey with four asses.

Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 33% Mephesto:
Oh, uh, I suppose so uh.  Oh yes, over here.  Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 34% Cartman:
Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 34% Mephesto:
And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 34% Kyle:
Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 35% Mephesto:
Oh.  Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice.  Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 35% Kyle:
Which song is that?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 35% Mephesto:
Diindoon - pig and elephant DNA just won't splice!  Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 35% Cartman:
You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!

Ow!

Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?

Oh, pardon me, I tripped.  Could I have some hair please?

Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy.

Whoa!  Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 81% Kyle:
Come on, let's go!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 81% Uncle Jimbo:
 There you are!  Stanley, you tore up my entire gun shop, you better have a good explanation for this mister!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 81% Stan:
It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 82% Mr. Garrison:
 Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?!  You have got severe lunchroom duty mister!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 82% Uncle Jimbo:
I'm gonna go have a word with your father Stanley.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 82% Mr. Garrison:
Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 83% Kyle:
Wait, Stan, there he goes.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 83% Stan:
Stop!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 83% Big Stan:
Ahhh, ba-ba-chomp?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 84% Kyle:
He recognizes you dude.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 84% Stan:
That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 84% Big Stan:
 Ba-chomp, eh mee ahh jaran.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 85% Kyle:
What should we do with him?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 85% Stan:
 Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 85% Big Stan:
Ahhhh, yeahhh.




発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 85% Stan:
…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 86% Big Stan:
Me bad??

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 86% Stan:
No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 86% Big Stan:
Ah.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 87% Shelly:
What the hell do you want?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 87% Big Stan:
Chewy-chewy-chomp.  Ahhh.  Uhhh.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 87% Mephesto:
 Boys! Boys, I'm lusciously sorry for everything.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 88% Terrance:
 Hey, they've got our clone.  He belongs to us.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 88% Mephesto:
No son, this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere.  Boys, I'm sorry I've caused you such - inconvenience.  I tried to play God, and I failed. 

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 88% Terrance:
Daddy! Nooooo!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 89% Mephesto:
All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed.  Perhaps we shouldn't be toying with God's creations.  Perhaps we should just leave nature alone, to its simple one assed schematics.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 89% Terrance:
You cheating bastards.  This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 89% Kyle:
 Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 90% Stan:
 Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 90% Cartman:
I ain't helpin' crap!  I want to eat some paeh.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 90% Stan:
You can't just leave me here alone.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 91% Cartman:
Oh yeah, watch me. 

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 91% Kyle:
Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.  See ya. 

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 91% Stan:
Thanks a lot.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 92% Shelly:
Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now. 

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 92% Stan:
It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 92% Randy:
 Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 92% Carol:
Everybody in town is upset with you young man.  What's going on?  Are you on drugs?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 93% Shelly:
It's not Stan's fault.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 93% Randy:
Huh?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 93% Shelly:
It wasn't Stan, he was…it was with me the whole time.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 94% Randy:
Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 94% Carol:
Oh honey, please forgive us son.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 94% Stan:
Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. 




発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 95% Mr. Garrison:
Everyone, let's give K. C. and his weed a big hand.  Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 95% Kyle:
Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 95% Mr. Garrison:
Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'.  Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 96% Terrance:
Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man.  I present to you, the five-assed monkey. 

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 96% Monkey:
Ahhheh.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 96% Mr. Garrison:
Oh, Mr. Hat, isn't it beautiful. 

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 97% Stan:
Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 97% Kid 1:
It had a baby?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 97% Kid 2:
Oh wow!

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 98% Clyde:
What's it look like?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 98% Kyle:
Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 98% Cartman:
Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 99% Mr. Garrison:
Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence?  Hmm, what are the odds of that?

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 99% Mr. Hat:
Hmmm. You boys get first prize.

発話者            Season_One   An_Elephant_Makes_Love_to_a_Pig 99% Cartman:
That'll do pig.

Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grampa.

And now back to Terrance &amp; Phillip

発話者            Season_One   Death 05% Phillip:
Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.

発話者            Season_One   Death 06% Terrance:
Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 06% Stan:

発話者            Season_One   Death 08% Stan:
'Cause, I'll get in trouble.

発話者            Season_One   Death 08% Grampa:
I killed my grampa when I was your age.

発話者            Season_One   Death 09% Stan:
Leave me alone grampa. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 09% Grampa:
What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own gramparents.




発話者            Season_One   Death 09% Phillip:
Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 10% Terrance:
Ohhh, you farted. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 10% Sheila:
Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching?

発話者            Season_One   Death 10% Terrance:
Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?

発話者            Season_One   Death 10% Phillip:
I sure would Terrance.

発話者            Season_One   Death 11% Terrance:
Alrighty then, here's a two-lip. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 11% Sheila:
What is this?  It's horrible!

発話者            Season_One   Death 11% Kyle:
 Dude, it's Terrance &amp; Phillip.

発話者            Season_One   Death 12% Phillip:

What did he say?

発話者            Season_One   Death 12% Terrance:
You're an asshole Phillip.

発話者            Season_One   Death 12% Sheila:
Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?  Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!

発話者            Season_One   Death 13% Kyle:
But everybody watches Terrance &amp; Phillip.

発話者            Season_One   Death 13% Sheila:
 Oh really? Is that so?




発話者            Season_One   Death 13% Terrance:
Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.

発話者            Season_One   Death 14% Phillip:
You're exactly right Terrance. Oh. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 14% Terrance:
Oh no. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 14% Cartman:
Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!

発話者            Season_One   Death 14% Liane:
Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.

発話者            Season_One   Death 15% Cartman:
That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!

発話者            Season_One   Death 15% Liane:
Ohhh, okay hon.




発話者            Season_One   Death 15% Stan:
I'm not going to kill you grampa!

発話者            Season_One   Death 16% Grampa:
Ingrate!

発話者            Season_One   Death 16% Stan:
Good night grampa.

発話者            Season_One   Death 16% Grampa:
You pompous son of a whore!




発話者            Season_One   Death 16% Student:
Huh huh, I had another ...

発話者            Season_One   Death 17% Kyle:
 Ow! What the hell was that for?!

発話者            Season_One   Death 17% Cartman:
That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance &amp; Phillip last night!

発話者            Season_One   Death 17% Clyde:
Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?

発話者            Season_One   Death 18% Kyle:
Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.

発話者            Season_One   Death 18% Cartman:
Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!

発話者            Season_One   Death 18% Mr. Garrison:
Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.

発話者            Season_One   Death 18% Cartman:
 Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?

発話者            Season_One   Death 19% Mr. Garrison:
She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance &amp; Phillip.

発話者            Season_One   Death 19% Class:
Yeahh, woohoo!

発話者            Season_One   Death 19% Mr. Hat:
Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison.

発話者            Season_One   Death 20% Mr. Garrison:
That's right Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance &amp; Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor.' They don't expand your minds.  You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash.  Kenny, why are you late to class?  Oh, okay Kenny, be seated.  Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because...  Yes Kenny, what is it?

発話者            Season_One   Death 20% Kenny:
(I have to go pee.)

発話者            Season_One   Death 20% Mr. Garrison:
I thought you just came from the bathroom.

発話者            Season_One   Death 20% Kenny:
(I did, I gotta go again...)

発話者            Season_One   Death 21% Mr. Garrison:
Okay okay, go ahead.  As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 21% Stan:
Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!

発話者            Season_One   Death 21% Mr. Garrison:
Pay attention children!  I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance &amp; Phillip any more, ever.

発話者            Season_One   Death 22% Cartman:
What?

発話者            Season_One   Death 22% Clyde:
Not watch Terrance &amp; Phillip ever? 

発話者            Season_One   Death 22% Mr. Garrison:
That's right children. Are there any questions?  Yes, Stanley?

発話者            Season_One   Death 22% Stan:
Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?

発話者            Season_One   Death 23% Mr. Garrison:
 What, what do you mean?

発話者            Season_One   Death 23% Stan:
My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.

発話者            Season_One   Death 23% Kyle:
Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.

発話者            Season_One   Death 24% Stan:
Really??

発話者            Season_One   Death 24% Kyle:
Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.

発話者            Season_One   Death 24% Stan:
Wow!

発話者            Season_One   Death 24% Cartman:
Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!

発話者            Season_One   Death 25% Stan:
So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?

発話者            Season_One   Death 25% Mr. Garrison:
Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole.

発話者            Season_One   Death 25% Kenny:
(Oh my God!)  (Owww!) 




発話者            Season_One   Death 26% Cartman:
Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance &amp; Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 26% Stan:
Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.

発話者            Season_One   Death 26% Kyle:

発話者            Season_One   Death 28% Stan:
Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?

発話者            Season_One   Death 29% Chef:
You can't kill my grampa Stan, he's already passed on.

発話者            Season_One   Death 29% Stan:
No, I mean, kill my grampa.

発話者            Season_One   Death 29% Chef:

発話者            Season_One   Death 30% Stan:
See, I told you dude.

発話者            Season_One   Death 30% Kyle:
Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?

発話者            Season_One   Death 30% Cartman:
Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?

発話者            Season_One   Death 30% Chef:
 I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.

発話者            Season_One   Death 31% Stan:
What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.




発話者            Season_One   Death 31% Sheila:
And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 31% Terrance:
Hey Phillip, guess what?

発話者            Season_One   Death 32% Phillip:

発話者            Season_One   Death 33% Sheila:

発話者            Season_One   Death 34% Stan:
No grampa, I'll get in trouble.

発話者            Season_One   Death 35% Grampa:
Kill me, God dammit!

発話者            Season_One   Death 35% Stan:
No, I can't even kill a deer.

発話者            Season_One   Death 35% Grampa:
Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?

発話者            Season_One   Death 36% Cartman:
I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.

発話者            Season_One   Death 36% Grampa:
 Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch.

You piece of crap! I'll kill you!

発話者            Season_One   Death 38% Grampa:
That's the spirit Tubby.

発話者            Season_One   Death 38% Stan:
 Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.

発話者            Season_One   Death 39% Cartman:
Don't talk about my mom like that!

発話者            Season_One   Death 39% Stan:
 We can go watch Terrance &amp; Phillip in the kitchen.

発話者            Season_One   Death 39% Grampa:

発話者            Season_One   Death 41% Kyle:
I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.

発話者            Season_One   Death 41% Stan:
Hey, yeah!




発話者            Season_One   Death 41% TV Announcer:

発話者            Season_One   Death 44% Martin:
Uh, yeah, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and-

発話者            Season_One   Death 44% Jesus:

発話者            Season_One   Death 44% Martin:
Oh, oh, okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus.

発話者            Season_One   Death 48% Stan:
Kyle, don't be such a butthole!

発話者            Season_One   Death 48% Cartman:
Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.

発話者            Season_One   Death 48% Kyle:
Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.

発話者            Season_One   Death 50% Grampa:
Billy, would you mind holding this for grampa please?

発話者            Season_One   Death 51% Stan:
Okay grampa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.

発話者            Season_One   Death 51% Terrance:
Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.

発話者            Season_One   Death 51% Phillip:
Well, don't fart on me Terrance.

発話者            Season_One   Death 51% Cartman:
Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.

(Oh my God!) 

発話者            Season_One   Death 52% Cartman:
Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny.

発話者            Season_One   Death 52% Phillip:
 You're such an asshole, Terrance.

発話者            Season_One   Death 53% Terrance:
Haha, that I am! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 53% Kenny:
 (Ow!)

発話者            Season_One   Death 53% Cartman:

発話者            Season_One   Death 54% Shelly:
No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grampa?! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 54% Grampa:

発話者            Season_One   Death 55% Stan:

発話者            Season_One   Death 56% Stan:
We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance &amp; Phillip and...

発話者            Season_One   Death 57% Talk Show Host:
Terrance &amp; Phillip, aha! So it is that show that is to blame.




発話者            Season_One   Death 57% Sheila:
These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!

発話者            Season_One   Death 57% Crowd:
Woooo!

発話者            Season_One   Death 57% Townsman:
Huh? Oh god! Oh god! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 58% Sheila:
We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come! 







発話者            Season_One   Death 58% Sheila:

発話者            Season_One   Death 58% Randy:
 Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.

発話者            Season_One   Death 60% Grampa:
Come here Billy, I want to show you something.

発話者            Season_One   Death 61% Stan:
Aww, do I have to?

発話者            Season_One   Death 61% Grampa:
Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me  is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grampa. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 61% Stan:
Hey, what are you doing?! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 61% Kyle:

発話者            Season_One   Death 63% Stan:
Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 63% Grampa:
That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grampa. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 63% Stan:
Eh, grampa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.

Look! It's the president of the network.

発話者            Season_One   Death 65% John Warzog:
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warzog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network.  Fuck you.  Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there.

発話者            Season_One   Death 69% Sheila:
The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?  Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all.

Yeah, but, mom!

発話者            Season_One   Death 77% Carol:

発話者            Season_One   Death 77% Randy:

発話者            Season_One   Death 77% Stan:

Mrrrr!

発話者            Season_One   Death 78% Stan:
Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.

発話者            Season_One   Death 78% Kyle:
Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.

発話者            Season_One   Death 79% Kenny:
(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)

発話者            Season_One   Death 79% Stan:
Totally dude.

発話者            Season_One   Death 79% Kyle:
Good point man.

発話者            Season_One   Death 79% Death:
Mrrrr! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 80% Kids:
Ahhhh!

発話者            Season_One   Death 80% Stan:
Quick, jump through the window.

発話者            Season_One   Death 80% Cartman:
Ehh, eh, ehhhh! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 81% Death:
Mrrrr!




発話者            Season_One   Death 81% Kids:
Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 81% Grampa:

発話者            Season_One   Death 81% Kids:

発話者            Season_One   Death 82% Grampa:

発話者            Season_One   Death 83% Terrance:
Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check? 

発話者            Season_One   Death 83% Phillip:
Oh, you farted. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 83% Terrance:
Ohho God. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 83% Terrance:
Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?

発話者            Season_One   Death 84% Phillip:
No Terrance, why don't you tell me?

発話者            Season_One   Death 84% Terrance:
Well, it smells like, a dirty fart! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 84% Stan:
 Hey look!

発話者            Season_One   Death 85% Phillip:
 Oh, there's one. 




発話者            Season_One   Death 85% Newscaster:
Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is...  Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 85% Townsman:
Wait, wait.

発話者            Season_One   Death 85% John Warzog:
Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked.  Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance &amp; Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Sommers.  Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 86% Townsman:
Huh, oh no! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 86% Sheila:
At last, now we can return to normality.




発話者            Season_One   Death 86% Terrance:
Hey Phillip.

発話者            Season_One   Death 87% Phillip:
Yes Terrance?

発話者            Season_One   Death 87% Terrance:
Is there a penny stuck in my butt?

発話者            Season_One   Death 87% Phillip:
Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check.

発話者            Season_One   Death 87% Cartman:
Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 88% TV Announcer:
We interrupt this program to bring you loud static. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 88% Death:
Mrrrrr!

発話者            Season_One   Death 88% Kids:
Ahhh!




発話者            Season_One   Death 89% Kyle:
Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!

発話者            Season_One   Death 89% Stan:
Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.

発話者            Season_One   Death 89% Grampa:
Hey, you were supposed to kill me!

発話者            Season_One   Death 89% Death:
Mrrr.

発話者            Season_One   Death 90% Grampa:
That's not fair, Goddammit! My grampa asked me to kill him and I did it. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 90% Stan:
Whoa!

発話者            Season_One   Death 90% Great-Great-Grampa:
Billllyyyy...

発話者            Season_One   Death 91% Grampa:
Grampa?

発話者            Season_One   Death 91% Great-Great-Grampa:
That's right, Billy.

発話者            Season_One   Death 91% Grampa:
My name's not Billy, grampa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?

発話者            Season_One   Death 91% Great-Great-Grampa:
I asked you to kill me Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity in limbo.

発話者            Season_One   Death 92% Grampa:
Limbo?

発話者            Season_One   Death 92% Great-Great-Grampa:
I was wrong to put you in that position Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what you're doing to his. You must wait to die of natural causes.

発話者            Season_One   Death 92% Grampa:
But I've been waiting for 25 years.

発話者            Season_One   Death 93% Great-Great-Grampa:
Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural causes... 

発話者            Season_One   Death 93% Stan:
Come on you guys, let's go home.

Here they are!

発話者            Season_One   Death 93% Randy:
Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.

発話者            Season_One   Death 94% Stan:
What do you mean?

発話者            Season_One   Death 94% Carol:
We got Terrance &amp; Phillip taken off the air.

発話者            Season_One   Death 94% Cartman:
You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!

発話者            Season_One   Death 95% Sheila:
But look what they put on. 

発話者            Season_One   Death 95% TV Announcer:
And now back to She's the Sheriff.

発話者            Season_One   Death 95% Cartman:
Ohhh, God, No!

発話者            Season_One   Death 95% Suzanne:
You are the one behind all these shenanigans.

発話者            Season_One   Death 96% Dude:
Yeah, well you're the stupid ho that started it.

発話者            Season_One   Death 96% Sheila:
What did he say?

発話者            Season_One   Death 96% Suzanne:
Up yours, buttmunch.

発話者            Season_One   Death 97% Sheila:
Whatwhatwhaaat!!!  Come on everybody, back to New York! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 97% Kyle:
Hey Stan, now that Terrance &amp; Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?

発話者            Season_One   Death 97% Stan:
I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.

発話者            Season_One   Death 97% Cartman:
My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.

発話者            Season_One   Death 98% Kyle:
Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?

発話者            Season_One   Death 98% Stan:
Cool!

発話者            Season_One   Death 98% Cartman:
Yeah! 

発話者            Season_One   Death 99% Stan:
What are you doing grampa?

発話者            Season_One   Death 99% Grampa:
I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?

発話者            Season_One   Death 99% Stan:
That's my silly grampa.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 02% Terrance:
It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here. 

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 02% Phillip:
AAAAAH!  Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 06% Sally Struthers:

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 16% Mr. Garrison:
Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?  Yes, Eric?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 16% Cartman:
When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 17% Mr. Garrison:
Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people.  A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 17% Stan:
You mean, like Kenny?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 17% Mr. Garrison:
Exactly.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 18% Cartman:
Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 18% Mr. Garrison:
 I don't know Eric, they just do.  Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 18% Cartman:
I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 19% Wendy:
Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 19% Cartman:
Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 20% Wendy:
This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 20% Cartman:
Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 20% Wendy:
Many would rather die than go to those places!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 21% Cartman:
Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 21% Mr. Garrison:
Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 21% Mr. Hat:
That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?




発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 22% Clyde:

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 22% Mr. Garrison:
 What the hell is going on?! 

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 22% Clyde:
Aaaah!




発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 23% Mr. Garrison:
Well, you don't see that everyday.




発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 23% The Mayor:
Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 24% Aide 2:
It should be something festive.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 24% Mephesto:
 Mayor, we've got a very big problem.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 24% The Mayor:
Ahh, you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 25% Mephesto:
Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 25% The Mayor:
 Uh huh.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 25% Mephesto:
You know, to provide food for the needy.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 26% The Mayor:
 Of course. 

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 26% Mephesto:
Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 26% The Mayor:
 Naturally.  Oh, do go on.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 27% Mephesto:
We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short.




発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 27% The Mayor:
 You were saying?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 27% Mephesto:
They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 28% The Mayor:
 Oh, my! 

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 28% Mephesto:
 Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 29% The Mayor:
Uh now why would you say that?




発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 29% Everybody:
Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 29% Cartman:
I get to use it first you guys!  Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 30% Liane:

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 30% Kyle:

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 34% Kyle:
Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 34% Stan:
Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 34% Kyle:

Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 41% Kyle:
Totally. 

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 41% Cartman:
Ahh!




発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 41% Woman:
Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 42% Man:
Not as beautiful as you.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 42% Woman:

This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 45% Cartman:
Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 45% Marvin:
Ap-ee-tizer.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 45% Cartman:

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 47% Mr. Garrison:
Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive.  And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?  Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.  Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 47% Stan:
Yeah, yeah, we do!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 48% Cartman:

We do!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 48% Mr. Garrison:
All right boys, show us what you've brought. 

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 49% Kyle:
This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin. 

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 49% Stan:
He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 49% Cartman:
 No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.  No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 50% Mr. Garrison:
Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 50% Stan:
He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 50% Mr. Garrison:
The sports watch from the commercial?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 51% Kyle:
Yeah, that one.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 51% Bebe:

Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 52% Class:
Yeah, I want one too, yeah me, me.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 53% Mr. Garrison:
Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 53% Kyle:
Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.




発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 53% Principal Victoria:
Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.  Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 54% Stan:
No.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 54% Principal Victoria:
You can't care for this child!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 54% Kyle:
But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 55% Principal Victoria:
Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 55% Stan:
So why can't he live here now?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 55% Principal Victoria:
Because he can't!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 56% Kyle:
Because why?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 56% Principal Victoria:
Because eight-year olds can't be parents!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 56% Kyle:
Then you take care of him.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 57% Principal Victoria:
 I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy.  I send my five dollars a month, see? 

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 57% Stan:
This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 58% Cartman:
Oh well, back to the poor country with you.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 58% Kyle:
You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 58% Cartman:
B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.




発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 59% Mephesto:
I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 59% Chef:

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 59% Mephesto:
Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 60% Chef:
Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 60% Mephesto:
Oh, whoops.  Now tell me what you see.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 60% Chef:
Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 61% Mephesto:
Precisely, but look how rapidly it's dividing.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 61% Chef:
What does it mean?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 62% Mephesto:
Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 62% Chef:
Oh, fudge!  Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 62% Mephesto:
Sure.

Sweet.




発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 64% The Mayor:
So how does this thing work?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 65% Aide:
Well mayor, it's based on the cash grab, but instead of money, the cans of food are blown around inside the capsule. The POV inside catches as many as he can to feed his family.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 65% The Mayor:
POVVVV?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 65% Aide:
Poverty stricken citizen.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 66% The Mayor:
Ohhoho, brilliant.  Daah!! What the hell is this!!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 67% Mephesto:
 They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 67% Chef:
It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!  Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 67% Kyle:

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 68% The Mayor:
 OKAY PEOPLE, DON'T PANIC! BRING OUT THE DEFENSE SQUAD! 

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 68% Mephesto:
We need more than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers!




発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 68% Terrance:
Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 69% Phillip:
Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 69% Terrance:
 Huh, eh,  wait wait wait.  Eh, eh.  Here it comes, ehhhh.  Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 70% TV Announcer:
We'll be back to part 14 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, right after this.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 71% Sally Struthers:
Hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. These children desperately need your support.

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 71% Cartman:

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 74% The Mayor:

I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? 

発話者            Season_One   Starvin'_Marvin 75% The Mayor:

or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas

Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas

We're all special in our own way
Everybody's different, but that's okay
'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin
Different points of view, be tall or thin
It doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin

With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been

Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...


 What were we talking about again?

発話者            Season_One   Damien 65% Reporter 2:
Satan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War? 

発話者            Season_One   Damien 65% Don King:
Let's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring.




発話者            Season_One   Damien 66% Cartman:

発話者            Season_One   Damien 67% Stan:
But you're his sparring partner, Chef.

発話者            Season_One   Damien 67% Kyle:

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 09% Tom:
You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want.

Oh, that's not bad.

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 11% Tom:
Of course, we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like this .

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 12% Mr. Garrison:
WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 12% Tom:
Alright-y then.  Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food.

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 12% Mr. Garrison:

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 17% Chef:
Thaat's right!

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 17% Wendy:

That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe.

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 59% Bebe:
Really?

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 60% Wendy:

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 75% Ms. Ellen:
What are you talking about?

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 75% Stan:
You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 76% Ms. Ellen:
Stan, I'm your teacher, okay? We're only friends.

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 76% Stan:
But why?

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 76% Ms. Ellen:
Well first of all, you're eight.

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 77% Mr. Garrison:
Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring.

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 78% Mr. Hat:
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison. 

発話者            Season_One   Tom's_Rhinoplasty 78% Mr. Garrison:

 I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 37% Leonard Maltin:
Damn! Then we must look for them elsewhere.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 37% Chef:
Come on, man. What is this all about?

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 38% Leonard Maltin:
If Barbra Streisand saw the same report I did, then those boys are in grave danger. If you were Barbra Streisand, where would you be right now?

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 38% Chef:
Hmmm. 

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 38% Leonard Maltin:
Nono! I mean, where would she be staying?

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 41% Barbra Streisand:
A cop showed up - he's a clever one - I can't blow everything now that I'm this close. Everything must be handled very carefully.  How many years has it been, Milo? Thirty? Forty? For so long I have waited to find the other triangle, and now I am so close. The Dawn of Zinthar is close at hand!

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 46% Leonard Maltin:
Are you sure Barbra Streisand has a condo up here?

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 46% Chef:
It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 46% Leonard Maltin:
Then we've got to keep looking.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 47% Chef:
 Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!

Haven't you ever been curious about the insanity Barbra Streisand exhibits?

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 47% Chef:
Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 48% Leonard Maltin:
More than a bitch! She's a calculating, self-centered egotistical bitch! She was born in a small town, her mother was a jackal, and her father was an insurance salesman.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 48% Chef:
Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman?

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 48% Leonard Maltin:
When she was five, she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer, but by the time she was six, her ambitions became to rule the univese. She learned of an ancient diamond, the Diamond of Pantheos.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 49% Chef:
Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!  Forget I asked!

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 49% Leonard Maltin:
Before she was seven the keepers of Pantheos learned of this insane little girl's wish. The diamond was split up, and buried at opposite ends of the world. But then, during the shooting of My Fair Lady, Barbra Streisand found one of the triangles.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 49% Chef:
And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 50% Leonard Maltin:
Yes, Mr. Chef. If Babs gets ahold of that other triangle, she will fulfill her prophecy, and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind. Mecha-Streisand!

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 50% Chef:
Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good.




発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 50% Stan:
Man, the bus sure is late.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 51% Cartman:
Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 51% Kyle:
Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 51% Barbra Streisand:
 Oh, hello there, little boys. How are you today?

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 52% Stan:
Fine.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 52% Barbra Streisand:
That is great. My name is Mrs. Jones, and I am a very friendly, nice person.  I hear that one of you found my triangle.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 52% Kyle:
Your triangle?

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 53% Barbra Streisand:
Yes. You see, that triangle is part of my kidney dialysis machine. I'm so glad you found it, because without it I was sure to die within hours.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 53% Cartman:
Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers!

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 53% Barbra Streisand:
But I'll die.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 53% Cartman:
Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can...

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 54% Barbra Streisand:
I want to give you a big cash reward for finding it. It's worth a lot of money to me.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 54% Cartman:
It is?

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 54% Stan:
Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 55% Barbra Streisand:
Oooh, hahahah. Who is that?

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 55% Kyle:
Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45. 

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 55% Stan:
Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 56% Cartman:
Yeeh, stealth bombers  Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen-

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 56% Barbra Streisand:
ENOUGH!!  Oh, Haa-ha. Anyway, if you'll come with me in my car, I'll take you up to my condo where I'll kill you - I I mean-uh, uh give you - moneyy - for the triangle.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 56% Cartman:
Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass! 

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 57% Kyle:
Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 57% Cartman:
No, not when money is involved, stupid! 




発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 57% Director:
And. Action!

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 58% Sidney Poitier:

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 66% Leonard Maltin:
Well, looks like we'll have to go to plan B.

発話者            Season_One   Mecha-Streisand 66% Chef:

And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
